# Tableau_Trade_Data

The Datasets selected are both IMF, International Monetary Fund,  datasets around International Trade. These datasets focus mainly on the imports and exports of the goods and services of each member country of the IMF. The two datasets were the, “Direction of Trade Statistics” and “International Trade in Services” datasets. The two datasets were joined at the country name to ease the use of the data when directly comparing. Within the years between 2010 and 2013 may have ITS next to them. This is to make sure that the values do not get mixed up with the other dataset named DOT.
I chose this dataset to demonstrate how only seeing one side of a visualization can give deceiving results and that we may not have the whole picture but need to make sense of a story. This can be showcased through the comparison of smaller countries with giant trade countries such as Russia and the US. Through this dataset one can also see how each country may differ in policy or the gap between countries. An example of this would be the % of world Service exports demonstrated by the US with almost double of the UK and those two being outliers relative to the other, or Botswana’s sudden growth in 2009.
